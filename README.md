This code solves the time independent Schroedinger equation in 1D with the non-parabolicity, m=m(z,E).

It uses 2 different algorithms that can be switched ON/OFF:

-> The FDM: Finite Difference Method

-> The Scanning/Shooting method using the Euler approach

Various models (1band, 2bands, 3bands and 6 bands in Kane or Luttinger approach) are available. 

A database of the most common semiconductor III-V , IV-IV and II-VI is provided and can be adjusted.

A strain model is included.
